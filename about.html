        <p>establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. 
            
            </p>
        <p>It served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wild fowl, and onions.[6]
            A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and beverages.
            <br/> These establishments were somewhat comparable to modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens. 
            <br/>In the Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae.[7]
